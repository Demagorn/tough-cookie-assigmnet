/**
 * CVE-2023-26136 Prototype Pollution Exploit
 * 
 * This script demonstrates the prototype pollution vulnerability in tough-cookie 2.5.0
 * when using CookieJar with rejectPublicSuffixes=false mode.
 * 
 * The vulnerability allows an attacker to pollute the Object.prototype by setting
 * cookies with malicious domain names like "__proto__".
 * 
 * POTENTIAL DAMAGE:
 * - Can modify behavior of all objects in the application
 * - May lead to denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution
 * - Affects the entire Node.js process and all objects created after pollution
 * - Can be used to bypass security controls or modify application logic
